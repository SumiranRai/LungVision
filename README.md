# **LungVision - Chest X-ray Classification**  

## **Overview**  
LungVision is an AI-powered web app that classifies chest X-ray images into **Normal, Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, or Unknown** categories. The model is based on **EfficientNet B3**, trained on a dataset of labeled chest X-ray images along with some natural images to simulate real-world scenarios.  

## **Features**  
âœ… Upload chest X-ray images for classification  
âœ… Provides confidence scores for predictions  
âœ… Grad-CAM visualization to highlight important regions in the X-ray  
âœ… Deployed using **Streamlit**  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Upload an X-ray image**  
2. **Model predicts one of the four classes**  
3. **Confidence score is displayed**  
4. **Grad-CAM overlay shows the important regions**  

## **Tech Stack**  
- **Model**: EfficientNet B3 (PyTorch)  
- **Framework**: Streamlit  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud
